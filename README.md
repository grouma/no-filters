A project quickly thrown together for the 2016 [#NoFilter](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2533447) festival, an exhibition of new works investigating the role of filters in our digital lives.

The application allows users to take pictures using predefined filters which change the stage lighting and dancer's movement in real time.

Technology used include Polymer Starter Kit, Photon Core, Adafruit NeoxPixel library and ALITOVE LED strip light.
